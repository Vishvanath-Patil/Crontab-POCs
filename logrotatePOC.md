To implement the POC for automated log rotation and cleanup, you can follow the steps below:

Log Rotation Configuration:

Install and configure the logrotate tool on your EC2 instances. This tool is commonly used for log rotation on Linux systems.
Create a log rotation configuration file for each application or service that generates logs. These files define the rotation frequency, compression, retention period, and other settings.
Place the log rotation configuration files in the /etc/logrotate.d/ directory.
Custom Script (Optional):

If you prefer to use a custom script instead of logrotate, you can create a shell script that performs the log rotation and cleanup tasks based on your defined retention policies.
The script should identify log files to rotate, compress or delete them based on the retention period, and handle any necessary log file path configurations.
Configure Cron Job:

Edit the crontab file for the user under which the log rotation tasks will run. Typically, you can use the root user or a dedicated user with sufficient permissions.
Run the command crontab -e to open the crontab file.
Add a cron job entry that runs at a specified frequency to trigger the log rotation tasks. For example:
bash
Copy code
0 0 * * * logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/status /etc/logrotate.d/*
This example runs the logrotate command daily at midnight (00:00) and specifies the log rotation configuration files to use.
Monitoring and Notifications:

Implement monitoring and notifications to track the log rotation status and detect any issues that may arise.
You can use AWS CloudWatch Alarms or other monitoring tools to monitor the log files' size, the success of log rotation tasks, and any error or warning messages generated during rotation.
Set up notifications through email, SMS, or integrations with monitoring and alerting systems to receive notifications when log rotation fails or encounters issues.
By following these steps, you will have an automated log rotation and cleanup solution in place. The log files generated by your applications or services will be rotated based on the defined retention policies, and old log files will be compressed or deleted to free up disk space. Monitoring and notifications will help you stay informed about the log rotation process's status and promptly address any issues that arise.

Please note that the specific commands and configurations may vary depending on your Linux distribution, log rotation tool, and requirements. It's essential to adapt the steps accordingly for your environment.
